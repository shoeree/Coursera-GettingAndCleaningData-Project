Coursera-GettingAndCleaningData-Project
=======================================
Project for the *Getting and Cleaning Data* course.

## Initial Setup Steps (Start here)

2. Using Windows or Linux, unzip the archive (e.g. using WinZip, 7zip, or some other program). Extract to the current directory.
* You will now have a folder called "UCI HAR Dataset" in your directory.

## Analysis Steps (Next do this)
